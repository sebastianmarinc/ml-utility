# ml-utility
This repo is to record a paper I presented at the 37th SIOP conference. The paper was about the utility of using variational autoenoders for parameter recovery as compared to multidimensional IRT. This was a kind of "lofi" simulation to seed the idea in the I/O psychology community.

# Project overview 
The project was to create a head-to-head comparison between VAEs and MIRT models. This is based on work by Curi et al. (2019) and Converse (2020). 

## What are the advantages of using VAEs?
